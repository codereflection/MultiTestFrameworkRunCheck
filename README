The sole purpose of this solution is to test the runtime of 
the most populate test frameworks for .NET.

Use a test runner such as TestDriven.NET on the Tests solution folder,
or on the entire solution itself, then compare the run times of the 
test frameworks in the test output.

Here's my initial run: http://gist.github.com/638733

Note: In order to get the Gallio tests to run, you have to install the Gallio framework, which can be grabbed from here: http://gallio.org/Downloads.aspx (I cannot tell you how much this bothers me).
